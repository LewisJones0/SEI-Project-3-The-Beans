  "bio": "My journey to coffee started at a very young age. At around six or seven years old I would sneakily sip some of my mother's instant coffee when she wasn't looking. I could say that this was the coffee seed planted inside me, which I would later return to after many years. Fast forward many moons, I got into specialty coffee around six years ago. When I tasted it I was immediately hooked. This wasn't coffee as I had known it before. I had known coffee for its more darker, harsher notes rather than its bright, light, juicy, floral notes.",
