Furthermore, there was more individuals co-developing on the same codebase, so developing the skills of managing git, github, branches, development with three people was extreamly valuable. 

This project also helped me develop a understanding of more complicated project planning. Our team of three individuals all had to develop the idea of the product, what would be the MVP, how the work should be split up, who will focus on what features & a timeline of when the features should be finsihed.
