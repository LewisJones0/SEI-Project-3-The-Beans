# Abstract: Post Project Thoughts and Project Overview

This project introduced a few new variables to developing a product incomparison to the first two projects on the course. This was the first full-stack application that we developed, so developing with Node.js, MongoDB, Express etc. was all a new learning experience. Furthermore, there was more individuals co-developing on the same codebase, so developing the skills of managing git, github, branches, development with three people was extreamly valuable. 

This project also helped me develop a understanding of more complicated project planning. Our team of three individuals all had to develop the idea of the product, what would be the MVP, how the work should be split up, who will focus on what features & a timeline of when the features should be finished.

 Spending hours developing this as a team taught me about how developing software isn't just about writing code, but rather that proper organisation and planning is crucial to be able to gather clarity on the vision of the product and generate forsight about potential roadblockers, as well as decompartmentalising the workload off into sections and splitting it fairly between teammates.

# Successes, Challenges and Bugs

One of the biggest successes, challenges and problems for me in this project was the filtration system on the Beans Index page. This section taught me alot about how to handle data recieved from the backend to produce a user experience where a customer can search through the products on the ecommerce website by specifed parameters. The parameters I focused on creating for this product were:

1. Filter by Price (Slider)

2. Filter by Roast type 
(ScreenshotPlaceholder)

One of the issues I had with it during the development of the project was that I couldn't figure out a way of filtering both of these at the same time. E.g. Filtering "Medium Roast" and "Price Scale: Â£10".

Due to time constraints, I decided to keep them seperate.

1: Price filteration would be done on the frontend, with a .filter method. This would then setState of the data that had a price equivilant to the one requested by the price slider.
2: Roast filteration would be done through a checkbox with the value string of the roast inside it. This would then set the state of the data displayed.

Both of the filters worked indepentantly but whenever a user wanted to utilise the other filter - I had to reset the data back to its original and apply the new filter to it. This is not a user experience I would be impressed with in a professional product and its a shame I didn't find the time to develop it more.
